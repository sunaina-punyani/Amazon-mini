  <h5><b>
  	Somewhere west of Kokomo, Indiana, in a contained and isolated area, NASA is conducting a secret study on human behavior...
  </b></h5>
  <br>
  <p>Given a set of rules and the promise of a generous compensation package at the end, can several hundred people govern themselves and live in relative harmony for six years?</p>
<p>
The experiment, designed to mimic future colonization on a distant planet, appears to be a huge success.
</p>
<p>
Until something goes terribly wrong…
</p>
<p>
Two undercover operatives from an ultra-clandestine government agency called The Circle are sent to investigate. When Diana Dawkins and Nicholas Colt discover the shocking truth, it’s clear the experiment must be stopped.
</p>
<p>
What isn’t clear is if they’ll make it out alive.</p>
